	<h2 id="one">1. What is asthma?</h2>
		<p>Asthma is a disease that affects your lungs. It is one of the most common long-term diseases of children, but adults can have asthma, too. Asthma causes wheezing, breathlessness, chest-tightness, and coughing at night or early in the morning. If you have asthma, you have it all the time, but you will have asthma attacks only when something bothers your lungs.</p>

	<h2 >2. What causes asthma?</h2>
		<p>We don't know all the things that can cause asthma, but we know that genetic, environmental, and occupational factors have been linked to developing asthma.</p>
 
		<p>If someone in your immediate family has asthma, you are more likely to have it. Genes can play a big part in developing allergic asthma. However, not all asthma is allergic asthma.</p>
		 
		<p>Being exposed to things in the environment like mold or allergens, and secondhand smoke have been linked to developing asthma. Air pollution and viral lung infection may also lead to asthma.</p>
		 
		<p>Occupation asthma occurs when someone who never had asthma develops it because he or she is exposed to something at work. This can happen if you develop to something at work such as mold at low levels over and over again or all at once at higher levels.</p>

	<h2 >3. What is an asthma attack?</h2>
		<p>An asthma attack may include coughing, chest tightness, wheezing, and trouble breathing. The attack happens in your body's airways, which are paths that carry air to your lungs. Normally these paths are wide open, but during an asthma attack, the airways swell and shrink. As a result, less air gets in and out of your lungs, and mucous that your body makes clogs up the airways.</p>

	<h2 >4. What causes an asthma attack?</h2>
		<p>An asthma attack can happen when you are exposed to "asthma triggers." Your asthma triggers may be different from someone else's asthma triggers. Know your triggers and learn how to avoid them.</p>
 
		<p>The most common asthma trigger is a <strong>viral respiratory infection</strong>, especially by a virus called human rhinovirus (RV). Seasonal infection by RV increases between September to December, and during spring. Common <strong>environmental triggers</strong> are mold and pollen. Some triggers are man-made. These include <strong>pollutants </strong>like tobacco smoke, particulate matter, and diesel exhaust.</p>

	<h2 id="five">5. How do I reduce my risk of an asthma attack?</h2>
		<p>Take your medicine exactly as your doctor tells you and stay away from things that can trigger an asthma attack.</p>
 
		<p>You can breathe in some medicines through an inhaler or take other medicines as pills. Asthma medicines come in two types-quick-relief and long-term control. Quick-relief medicines control the symptoms of an asthma attack. Long-term control medicines help you have fewer and milder attacks, but they don't help you while you are having an asthma attack.</p>
